        This project was completed as a demo of a business model. It is a legal metaverse platform that allows attorneys to do their jobs online and meet their clients.

        Lawverse marked my first implement of multiplayer system with Photon Engine, and I also added webcam displaying and screen sharing for the first time.

        I definitely feel that working on the AI resonated with me the most, I implemented hierarchical state machines for my complex AI, and a simple state machine for a basic version of the AI (as requested by the specification). 
        However, the section of which I am most proud of is my implementation for precomputed A* maps, I was the only student in my class to attempt this method, and it worked tremendously well! Combined with pre-processing map data into files, this resulted in a constant cost of A* path calculation during run-time, which allowed me to include a very large number of AI units.
