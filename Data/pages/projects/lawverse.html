        This project was completed as a demo of a business model.

        The physics system is based on Newtonian Physics, which involve forces acting on matter whilst adhering to the laws of motion and gravity, with this implementation using semi-implicit Euler integration.
        There are a variety of collision detection methods, which dynamically use projection, impulse, penalty and constraint resolutions in order to simulate dynamic behaviour between entities and their environment.
        In the future I would be interested in attempting to implement the GJK algorithm for convex shape collisions.

        I definitely feel that working on the AI resonated with me the most, I implemented hierarchical state machines for my complex AI, and a simple state machine for a basic version of the AI (as requested by the specification). 
        However, the section of which I am most proud of is my implementation for precomputed A* maps, I was the only student in my class to attempt this method, and it worked tremendously well! Combined with pre-processing map data into files, this resulted in a constant cost of A* path calculation during run-time, which allowed me to include a very large number of AI units.
