        Escapist is a text-based escape room game, it provides users various choices and they leads you to various endings.

        The inspiration for MQL came from SQL, as we wanted to create a simple, human readable programming language which could be taught to both experienced, and non-experienced programmers.

        The implementation was done completely using the Haskell programming language, I really enjoyed this experience as functional programming was a new method of development for me, and it felt more like solving a long puzzle, which was very engaging.

        I feel that this project widely increased my views on the capabilities of programming languages and made me think about them in a new light. More specifically, every time I engage in learning a new language, I try to look at it from the language writer's point of view, also I search for fun and useful additions to the language that they may have added!
