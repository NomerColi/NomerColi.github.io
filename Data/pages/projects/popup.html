        PopUp is a 3D puzzle game made in a game jam held at HKU University in Netherlands. I developed the basis of the game: furniture placement system, player controller system. It was first time I put 3D models in games.
        <br>
        <br>
        Developing it with local students, I learnt how to cooperate in a big group and research about a serious subject, it was sustainability.

        You can download the game in the itch.io linked above.
